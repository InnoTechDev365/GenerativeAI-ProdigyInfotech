🎨 Neural Style Transfer with TensorFlow
📝 Overview
This project demonstrates Neural Style Transfer (NST) — a deep learning technique that blends the content of one image with the style of another, producing a unique image that looks like a piece of art.

Implemented using TensorFlow and TensorFlow Hub, the model takes a content image (e.g., a photograph) and a style image (e.g., a painting by Kandinsky) and generates a new image combining both.

✨ Key Features
✅ Load and preprocess content and style images
✅ Apply a pre-trained NST model from TensorFlow Hub
✅ Convert output tensors back to images for visualization
✅ Experiment with different content-style combinations
✅ Fully executable in Google Colab

🚀 How It Works
Load Images

content_image: A regular photograph (e.g., Labrador dog)
style_image: A piece of artwork (e.g., Kandinsky painting)
Preprocess Images

Resize, normalize, and format for model input
Apply Style Transfer

Use a pre-trained model from tensorflow_hub to apply style onto content
Post-process & Display

Convert the output tensor into an image and display the result
🧪 Sample Output
Content Image	Style Image	Stylized Output
🐶 Labrador	🖌️ Kandinsky	🎨 Dog in Kandinsky Style

📂 Usage
📁 Open in Google Colab
Upload the notebook Task05_Style_Transfer.ipynb to Google Colab
Run all cells in order
Replace or add your own images if desired
🖼 Change Input Images
To try different images:

content_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file('your_photo.jpg', 'image_url')
style_path = tf.keras.utils.get_file('your_artwork.jpg', 'style_url')
